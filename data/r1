Dominion Engineering, Inc. (DEI; domeng.com) is a small (~40-person) company that supports the commercial energy industry in the US and abroad with technology, laboratory R&D testing, and consulting. The working environment at DEI is close-knit and professional, but not overly formal. Typical project teams are 2-3 persons working together and in collaboration with the Customer. Newer employees work under the general mentorship of more senior engineers, while still maintaining fairly autonomous roles, roles that may evolve over time to meet emergent needs.

One of DEI’s areas of expertise is degradation of nuclear power plant materials. This position would provide engineering analysis support to DEI project managers and subject matter experts for materials degradation projects and may also be called upon to provide support to other emergent DEI projects.
